# DataIntakeTerraform

## Overview

This repository contains Terraform configurations for deploying and managing data intake infrastructure. The project automates the setup of resources required for data ingestion pipelines, such as storage buckets, queues, and compute resources, on a cloud provider (e.g., AWS). It follows Terraform best practices to ensure scalable, modular, and maintainable infrastructure as code.

## Features

- **Modular Design**: Organized into reusable Terraform modules for data intake components.
- **Cloud-Agnostic (Optional)**: Configurable for deployment on AWS, Azure, or GCP (update based on actual implementation).
- **Scalable Infrastructure**: Provisions resources like S3 buckets, SQS queues, or equivalent services for data ingestion.
- **CI/CD Integration**: Compatible with GitHub Actions for automated deployment and testing.

## Prerequisites

Before using this project, ensure you have the following installed:

- **Terraform**: Version 1.5.0 or higher ([Install Terraform](https://www.terraform.io/downloads.html))
- **AWS CLI** (if using AWS): Configured with appropriate credentials ([AWS CLI Setup](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/cli-configure-quickstart.html))
- **Git**: For cloning the repository
- A cloud provider account with sufficient permissions to create and manage resources

## Getting Started

### Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/pradeep515/DataIntakeTerraform.git
cd DataIntakeTerraform
```

### Initialize Terraform

Initialize the Terraform working directory to download required providers and modules:

```bash
terraform init
```

### Configure Variables

Create a `terraform.tfvars` file or specify variables to customize the deployment. Example:

```hcl
region           = "us-east-1"
bucket_name      = "data-intake-bucket"
queue_name       = "data-intake-queue"
environment      = "production"
```

Refer to `variables.tf` for all available variables and their descriptions.

### Deploy Infrastructure

1. **Plan**: Review the planned changes:

```bash
terraform plan
```

2. **Apply**: Deploy the infrastructure:

```bash
terraform apply
```

Confirm the apply operation by typing `yes` when prompted.

### Destroy Infrastructure

To tear down the infrastructure:

```bash
terraform destroy
```

## Usage Example

To deploy a data intake pipeline in AWS:

1. Configure `terraform.tfvars` with your desired settings.
2. Run `terraform init` and `terraform apply`.
3. Verify resources in the AWS Management Console (e.g., S3 buckets, SQS queues).
4. Use the outputs (defined in `outputs.tf`) to integrate with other systems.

Example output:

```hcl
output "bucket_arn" {
  value = module.storage.bucket_arn
}
output "queue_url" {
  value = module.queue.queue_url
}
```

## Contributing

Contributions are welcome! To contribute:

1. Fork the repository.
2. Create a feature branch (`git checkout -b feature/your-feature`).
3. Commit your changes (`git commit -m "Add your feature"`).
4. Push to the branch (`git push origin feature/your-feature`).
5. Open a pull request.

Please ensure your code follows Terraform best practices and includes tests where applicable.
